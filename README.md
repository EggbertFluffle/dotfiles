# Eggbert's Dotfiles

The dotfiles contained in the repo and anything to note about them:

* .zshrc - Very unorganized and spesific to my system
* alacritty
* ranger - Nice for image previewing
* hypr - I almost never use this
* picom.conf
* .dwm - Only the script for the autostart patch

# Where's (insert thing you don't see)
Well, if it is any of the following you can find them in seperate repositiries linked below.

* [Neovim](https://github.com/EggbertFluffle/nvim)
* [dwm](https://github.com/EggbertFluffle/dwm)
* [slstatus](https://github.com/EggbertFluffle/slstatus)

Otherwise *womp womp* :c

## Installation
Just use the shell script `./install.sh`. This will create backups with a `.bak` file extension of a config/dotfile already exists in the place of the copy.

## Sync current dotfiles
Using `./sync.sh` will copy all of the spesified configs/dotfiles into the current folder
